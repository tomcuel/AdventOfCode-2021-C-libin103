I will do Advent Of Code 2021 using C 

here is the link of the website : https://adventofcode.com/2021

I will do it in english as the 2022 in Python, to get used to code in english 

I will use the libin103 library : 
- it's a library made for a lesson at my engineering school by a teacher, it's well made  
- here's the link to get the documentation (very pratical to know what's in there)
- https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~chapoutot/teaching/in103/refman/index.html
- because it will allow me to code in C without the difficulty of having to code every tree traversal such as DFS or BFS
